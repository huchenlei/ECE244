* typedef
  typedef struct something{
   ...
   ...
  } something
  "something" would replace "struct something"

* .h and .cc/.cpp file
  all could be included by "#include"
  but only .h is recommended to be included(saving the compilation time)

* struts(classes) and functions can not be decleared twice
  avoid including the same .h file more than once

* #ifndef(if not defined)
  should be paired by #endif
  prevent multiple inclusion
